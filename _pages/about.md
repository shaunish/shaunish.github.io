# Hi!

![Profile Picture](/images/profile_pic.png)

My name is Shaunish Mookerji, and I'm passionate about data, engineering, and startups. Previously, I've worked as a hardware engineer at Intel, and as a venture investor into early-stage tech startups at Silicon Road Ventures. Check out my [github](https://github.com/shaunish) or my [archive](https://shaunish.github.io/archive/) on this website to see some of my work. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a bachelor's in computer engineering in 2017, and I'm currently back at Tech pursuing a Master's degree in data analytics (Go Jackets!).

I'm a native of Atlanta, Georgia, where I still reside today. When I'm not studying or programming, you can find me on a tennis court or trying to achieve the perfect medium-rare steak.
